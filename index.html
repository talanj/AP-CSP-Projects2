    <h2>Candle Picture</h2>
    <p><a></a></p>
    <p>This picture was one of the first pictures I was able to make using code. I used elements such as RGB and shapes to create it. I also found out how to dim or make a light brighter which created the glowing candle effect. One of the challenges I faced was creating the candle’s shadow, as I wasn’t very good with overlapping shapes but I eventually got over it.</p>

    <h2>Polygon Generator</h2>
    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898515636">Polygon Generator</a></p>
    <p>A partner and I coded this game to draw different polygons based on size and location. At first, this was a difficult task and it seemed much more complex than it was actually. We eventually figured out that the main idea behind the game would be to find a formula that could calculate the outside angles of each polygon simply based on the amount of slides it has. Once we figured this out we were able to apply it to every polygon, the only difference we had to make in the code was the angle that we would turn the sprite. It was interesting seeing how math and coding go together.</p>

      <h2>Robotic Bug</h2>
      <p><a></a></p>
      <p>This was a project I made during freshman year, it was a robotic bug that had glowing red eyes and would walk forward if I remember correctly. This was a project that I soldered, which meant there was some room for error, and I did make a few mistakes while creating it. For example, when I soldered the battery piece to the back of the bug, A small piece of solder got stuck, so the bug wouldn’t turn on. I didn’t know this was the cause until thoroughly troubleshooting but eventually I figured it out. I also had slight trouble with soldering the legs but that was simply due to my inexperience. After all was said and done, the project came out amazing and I was shocked to see how well it worked.</p>

        <p>My project for the Fall Genius Hour was a app called the "Genre Identifier" the main purpose of this app was to predict the genre of a song on the BillBoard's Top 100 songs, based on it's peak position on the chart and how many weeks it was on the charts.</p>

        <p>This was a project my partner and I created for our AP Create Final Project, the main use of this app was to allow the user to create a shopping list based on the items that are present in the story, the app would allow you to find which aisle the item you're looking for is in. You can then go shopping in the virtual store to find that item.</p>

      <p>This was a project my partner and I completed. We had small Raspberry Pico pieces, and we used an app called Thonny to send information to it. We were able to code it to light up like a stop light using the LED piece on the picture.</p>
